# Questions/Suggestions

1. CDN/centralized module repository
	* This is separate from TFS. A place to house things like commonly used or custom Umbraco packages.
2. Ownership or at least input in B*Works front end workflow for the dev team.
	* Wholesale solutions from BHiveLabs may not be appropriate
	* Ownership promotes growth and confidence 
3. Standardize frameworks used in B*Works projects
	* Continue to research and be open to new processes
	* Discuss new ideas within the team. Use the GitHub group to propose new ideas/present proof of concepts
