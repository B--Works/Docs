# B*Works Mac Development Guidelines
While we understand that Brunner/B*Works is a Microsoft shop, we feel that there are ways for other work environments to coexist in the current workflow. Text editors and IDEs command the majority of our time at the office, and this allows developers to use the tools with which they are most comfortable and productive. Without a full fledged QA process, allowing for development on other platforms is also crucial for testing our work as we are developing.

## Advantages

* Developers are free to use the tools with which they are most productive, while still adhering to existing requirements and best practices.
* More options are available for browser testing.
* Virtual machines can be installed for access to a Windows environment, for both development and testing purposes.
